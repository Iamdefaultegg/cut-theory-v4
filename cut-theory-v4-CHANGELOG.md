# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository will be documented here.

## [v1.0.0] — 2025-12-29
### Added
- Cut Theory v4.0 — Core Canon manuscript draft (`CUT_THEORY_v4_0_CORE_CANON.md`)
- Publication scaffolding: README, License, Citation, Changelog

### Notes
- “Interfaces” (math/physics/life/mind) are treated as mapping layers, not foundations.
- Future releases that do not change primitives increment minor versions (v1.1, v1.2, …).
- Any change to primitives triggers a major canon bump (v5.0) with an explicit break list.
