## Abstract

Cut Theory proposes a minimal generative canon. Structured worlds require:

- **Identity**: the recognizability of “the same” across transitions.
- **Cut**: an operation that introduces categorical separation (inside/outside).

From these, the canon defines boundary, tension, recurrence, fabric, slice, dimensional accumulation, traversal (time-like ordering), and agency-like selection as necessary consequences or practical handles. The framework is a constraint engine: it does not assert a unique physics, but supplies explicit interface mappings and falsifiable tests.

---

## What this is and isn’t

**This is:**
- a minimal ontology
- an operator grammar
- a necessity chain
- testable interfaces

**This is not:**
- a finished physical theory claiming unique equations  
- a single “final” mapping from the canon to physics

The physics layer is explicitly a mapping layer intended to be tested, revised, or replaced.

## 1 — Two Primitives

### P1 — Identity

Identity is the minimal requirement that some pattern can be recognized as the same across transitions.

- Not a substance
- Not an object
- A criterion: “this persists enough to count as itself”

### P2 — Cut

A cut is an operation that introduces a categorical separation: inside/outside (marked/unmarked, this/not-this).

- A cut is not assumed spatial
- Space can emerge later as a stable adjacency structure

**Primitive claim:** Everything else in the canon is either a consequence of Identity and Cut, or a handle that compresses repeated consequences for human readability.

---

## 2 — Derived Handles

These are not extra metaphysics. They are compact names for forced consequences.

### Distinction

A distinction is a cut that has become meaningful because identity exists to register “same vs different.”

### Boundary

A boundary is a stabilized distinction: the persistent edge of a cut.

Boundary is primarily categorical. Crossing it is a change in what the system treats as possible.

### Tension

Tension is the relational pressure created because the two sides of a boundary are no longer the same.

Tension is not assumed to be a physical force. It is the demand that difference must now be accounted for.

### Recurrence

Recurrence is the survival of a boundary-pattern across transitions.

Recurrence is identity-in-action.

### Fabric

A fabric is a network of mutually reinforcing recurrences.

A fabric is relational structure: stable continuations constrain each other.

### Slice

A slice is an operation that rewrites an existing boundary.

Cuts introduce structure. Slices transform structure.

### Dimension

A dimension is a recurrence-pattern that remains coherent under the slice events available in that fabric.

A “dimension” is an invariant degree of freedom under permitted transformations.

### Agency

Agency is active identity preservation through selective recurrence.

It is selecting continuations that maintain coherence under constraints.

---

## 3 — Operators

### Cut

Creates a categorical separation and therefore creates sides.

### Slice

Acts only on already-structured boundaries: cuts, loops, fabrics.

A slice rewrites adjacency without reducing everything to “no structure.”

Canonical slice outcomes:
1. Preserve identity: boundary survives and complexity increases
2. Shift identity: boundary reorients or domain changes
3. Divide identity: one coherence becomes multiple coherences

### Collapse

Collapse occurs when slicing exceeds what a structure can redistribute.

Identity loses coherence and falls back to earlier recurrence.

### Diagonalization

Diagonalization appears when recurrence cannot remain symmetric.

A persistent lean survives instead of cancelling out. Diagonalization is the seed of new degrees of freedom.

### Emergence

Emergence occurs when a new stable recurrence survives slicing and becomes a new layer of structure.

---

## 4 — The Necessity Chain

If Identity exists and Cut is possible, the following chain is unavoidable.

1. **Cut → Boundary**  
   Inside/outside implies a boundary relation.
2. **Boundary → Tension**  
   Difference across a boundary produces relational pressure.
3. **Tension → Recurrence**  
   Repeated resolution of tension stabilizes a pattern.
4. **Recurrence → Fabric**  
   Multiple stable recurrences constrain each other into a network.
5. **Fabric → Slice**  
   Once a network exists, boundary rewrites become the minimal form of change that preserves partial structure.
6. **Slice → Dimension**  
   Consistent slice biases stabilize invariant degrees of freedom.
7. **Dimension → richer Identity**  
   Identity becomes navigable continuity across slice sequences.
8. **Identity → Agency**  
   Once continuity exists, selection can preserve it.

**One-line summary:**  
A coherent world is identity surviving cuts, updating through slices, stabilizing into fabrics, and growing dimensions where invariants persist.

## 5 — Minimal Formal Interface

This is the leanest formal playground the canon can inhabit without adding new primitives.

### 5.1 State domain

Let **U** be a finite or countable set of abstract states.

### 5.2 Cut as indicator

A cut is a function **C: U → {0,1}**, partitioning U into inside/outside.

### 5.3 Dynamics as transitions

Let **M** be a row-stochastic transition kernel on U.

### 5.4 Identity as recurrence under dynamics

A region behaves as a persistent identity when it forms a recurrence-supporting subset under M.

### 5.5 Stability criterion

A cut-defined block **B ⊆ U** is stable when it is closed under the dynamics: no transitions escape B.

This supplies a concrete identity preservation condition in a minimal dynamical setting.

### 5.6 Slice as coupling

A slice is modeled as a perturbation that introduces controlled permeability between previously separated regions:

**M(ε) = M + εS**

This captures boundary rewriting as change in adjacency weights.

### 5.7 Tension metrics

Tension can be quantified as:
- imbalance across partitions, such as total variation across blocks
- informational asymmetry, such as KL-based measures
- mixing resistance, such as spectral gap

Interpretation: higher permeability tends to reduce localized identity, shifting the system toward global mixing.

## 6 — Thermodynamics

### Heat

Heat is chaotic micro-slicing inside a fabric.

### Temperature

Temperature is average slice volatility of a region: how many viable micro-slices per step.

### Work

Work is directed slice-control that preserves or reshapes a target identity.

### Entropy

Entropy is boundary blur.

More precisely: how many micro-identities can realize the same macro-identity.

### Second Law

In sufficiently complex fabrics with uncontrolled slicing, recoverable boundary structure tends to diffuse because fine constraints are fragile under slicing, while reconstruction requires coordinated recurrence across many degrees of freedom.

---

## 7 — Tests and Falsifiability

### T1 — Permeability sweep

Create two regions with adjustable coupling **ε**.

Prediction: as ε increases past a threshold, multiple local identities collapse toward a unique global stationary behavior.

### T2 — Linear response near separation

Near ε ≈ 0, leading-order identity leakage scales linearly with ε in the perturbation model.

### T3 — Fabric geodesics

Construct an empirical recurrence graph and compare observed propagation to paths minimizing integrated “tension cost” under the chosen metric.

More detailed protocols belong in an appendix.

## 8 — Scope Boundaries and Correction Policy

### Canon lock

The canon contains only:
- primitives: Identity, Cut
- derived handles: boundary, tension, recurrence, fabric, slice, dimension, agency
- operators and the necessity chain
- minimal test interfaces

### Mappings are provisional

Physics, biology, and cognition mappings are interfaces, not foundations.

If an interface fails tests, revise the interface without changing primitives unless forced.

### Correction policy

- Corrections that do not change primitives: publish as a new version.
- Primitive changes: declare a major version bump and list what breaks downstream.

---

## 9 — Optional Lens: Co-Emergence

Co-emergence language may be used as a narrative lens, such as “identity and cut arise together.”

It is not required as a primitive in the canon.

It is allowed only as explanatory compression and must not introduce new operators or irreducible assumptions.
