# Cut Theory v4.0

A minimal generative canon for coherent structure, change, and emergence.

Cut Theory is presented as a **constraint engine**:
- **Primitives:** Identity + Cut
- **Derived handles:** boundary, tension, recurrence, fabric, slice, dimension, agency
- **Goal:** keep the canon small, readable, and stable, while allowing interface layers (math/physics/life/mind) to be tested, revised, or replaced.
